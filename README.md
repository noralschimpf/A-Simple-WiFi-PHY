# A-Simple-WiFi-PHY
Final Project for ECE-526: Introduction to Labview

This project Implements a hierarchical design for Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). Each tool is implemented using Labview base tools, and provides an A/B comparison to implementations using the Labview RF Communications Toolbox.

The tools are implemented with a local workbench `Top VI.vi`.

Documentation of the project development and technical background is available under `Documentation`.

## Project Requirements 
In order to operate the project, first install the [Modulation Toolbox](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/software-products/download.labview-modulation-toolkit.html#338805) for the appropriate version of Labview.

The project was implemented with NI Labview 2018.2.
